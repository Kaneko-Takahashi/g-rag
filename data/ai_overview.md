# AI Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

## Key Concepts

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning, in turn, is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

## Applications

AI is used in various fields including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Recent advances in large language models have enabled new applications in natural language processing and generation.

## History

The field of AI was founded in the 1950s, with early work focusing on symbolic reasoning and expert systems. The modern era of AI began with the development of machine learning algorithms and the availability of large datasets and computational resources.
